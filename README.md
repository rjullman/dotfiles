# dotfiles
My system configuration source-controlled and scripted for automated setup.

This was originally inspired by https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/script/bootstrap and since has been influence by many other publicly posted dotfile repositories.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:rjullman/dotfiles.git`.
2. Run `dot` to kick off the setup process.  This exact code will only work on OSX (where I mostly develop), 
but the various scripts are easily pluggable.
Read https://github.com/rjullman/dotfiles/blob/master/dot to see how things work and to add more (or remove existing) automated setup.
